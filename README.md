# CTF-Chronicles

## Welcome to CTF-Chronicles, a repository containing detailed walk-throughs of various CTF challenges.

My walk-throughs cover a range of CTF challenges, including web exploitation, binary exploitation, reverse engineering, cryptography, and more. Each walk-through provides step-by-step instructions, detailed explanations of the concepts and techniques involved, and insights into the thought process behind solving the challenge.

Whether you're new to CTFs or a seasoned veteran, I hope you'll find my walk-throughs to be a valuable resource. I encourage you to explore the different challenges and share your feedback and suggestions for additional content.

Join me on my CTF journey, and let's explore the fascinating world of cybersecurity together!
