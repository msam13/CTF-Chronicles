## Level 2

This one took me some time. Firstly, I thought the file/pixel.png would have the key, but it didn't. Next, I tried checking the files. Files had user.txt, which had some login credentials along with natas3 credentials

## Level 3
<i> Clue : No more information leaks!! Not even Google will find it this time...</i><br>
Apparently, websites have a robots.txt, that will have instructions as to how a web robot or clawer(search enginer like google), should claw a website. 

Going to http://natas3.natas.labs.overthewire.org/s3cr3t/users.txt, gives the password for next page.

<i>Access disallowed. You are visiting from "http://natas4.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php" while authorized users should come only from "http://natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org/"</i> <br>
I tried, but i failed, so looked this one up and found : there's a parameter in the request header - <b> Referer </b> <br>
This parameter, tell where the request came from.
With that knowledge, using Burpsuit I modified the request header's referer parameter to http://natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org/ and got the passcode.

## Level 8
clue : 
```
$encodedSecret = "3d3d516343746d4d6d6c315669563362";

function encodeSecret($secret) {
    return bin2hex(strrev(base64_encode($secret)));
}

if(array_key_exists("submit", $_POST)) {
    if(encodeSecret($_POST['secret']) == $encodedSecret) {
    print "Access granted. The password for natas9 is <censored>";
    } else {
    print "Wrong secret";
    }
}
?>
```
I'm great at cryptograpy, so this is a peice of cake xP
On applying filters in the following order on cyberchef <br>
* From Hex
* Reverse
* From base64

Get the secret code, on putting the secret code we get the passcode
